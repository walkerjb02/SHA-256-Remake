# For the blockchain component of my accounting project, I decided to remake the hashing algorithm from the ground up as opposed to using hashlib. 
# This project really helped my understanding of what's going on behind the scenes and I will be using it in the blockchain my accounting project will be using.
# The guide I used to create this project can be found here: https://github.com/in3rsha/sha256-animation the original code was in Ruby but the animations he created to explain how the process worked was invaluable!
# Happy with the result of this project as, by not using any libraries, my understanding of Python was greatly increased!
